Connect Surfer's Content Editor to WordPress. Write and optimize your articles for SEO, find new keyword ideas and publish straight to WordPress.

== Description ==

Connect Surfer’s Content Editor to WordPress and make writing content, discovering keywords, and optimizing your work for SEO a breeze. 

== SURFER’S OFFICIAL WORDPRESS PLUGIN ==
Surfer’s free WordPress plugin that connects your WordPress page to Surfer’s Content Editor. Surfer’s WP plugin just saved you a step (or 2!). Write, publish and start ranking. 

== EASY SETUP AND FAST INTEGRATION ==

* Work in WordPress using Surfer’s Content Editor without any hassle
* Create a Content Editor directly in WordPress, or export it to Surfer
* Track how many clicks and impressions your posts generated directly in WordPress

== AVOID FORMATTING ISSUES AND INCONSISTENCIES ==
CTRL + A, CTRL + C, CTRL + V, in two clicks! What you write in Surfer’s Content Editor is what you’ll get (and see) when you publish on WordPress.

Headings, images and text are converted block by block and transferred seamlessly from Surfer’s interface to your WordPress site.

Images are downloaded and stored on WordPress and are accessible in your media library versus an external link which improves performance and SEO!

Surfer’s Plugin currently supports the two most widely used WordPress text editors: Gutenberg and Classic Editor (and can distinguish between the two!).

V.1, V.2 V.3? **With Surfer plugin you always publish the current and correct version of your article without the copy-paste confusion.**

== OPTIMIZE AND IMPROVE EXISTING ARTICLES ==
Keep your content relevant and competitive with periodic updates to keep climbing the SERPs!

Use Surfer’s Content Editor to refresh your article and optimize its keywords for an even better performance.

Finally, once you’re satisfied with the improvements, publish the updated piece on WP. You can also easily access all your WordPress articles in the Content Editor!
